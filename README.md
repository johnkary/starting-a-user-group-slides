### Abstract

User Groups provide a sense of community for those using specific technologies or simply working in a specific region. Members come together to socialize, discuss the latest topics in their area of interest, hone their presentation skills, and make professional and personal connections. Many of these connections lead to deeper learning, future jobs and even deep friendships. This is the power of community!

Have you ever thought about organizing a user group? How do you even start? And what do you do once you have a room full of attendees? What do you do when you have a mix of junior and senior attendees? What about ideas for events to satisfy the varying interests your members will have? And as your group evolves and people come and go, how do you keep the magic alive? In this talk John shares ideas to answer all of these questions, drawing from his experience attending over 100 user group meetings and serving as co-organizer of two programming user groups in the Kansas City area, one running strong for over 10 years.
